# Hi, I'm **tasal9** üëã

I‚Äôm a software engineer focused on building practical, scalable systems across **AI**, **Web Development**, and **Cloud**. I work primarily with **Python**, **JavaScript**, and modern machine learning tooling‚Äîturning ideas into usable, extensible products.

---

## What I Do

- Design and implement AI-enhanced services and developer-facing tools  
- Build full‚Äëstack features (APIs, integrations, lightweight UIs) with a bias toward clarity and iteration speed  
- Automate and structure ML workflows: data prep, inference orchestration, evaluation, deployment  
- Evolve projects from prototype ‚Üí maintainable architecture with clean extension points  

---

## Featured Projects

| Project | Role & Focus |
|---------|--------------|
| **ZamAI** | Core AI / ML platform (or framework) I‚Äôm building / maintaining. (Add a one‚Äëline: e.g., ‚ÄúUnified layer for model orchestration, evaluation, and integration into apps.‚Äù) |
| **ZamAI-Zeerak** | Complementary module / subsystem. (Add a one‚Äëline: e.g., ‚ÄúInsight / analytics layer for monitoring, benchmarking, or intelligent retrieval.‚Äù) |

> Replace the placeholder summaries above with crisp, outcome‚Äëoriented descriptions (What it does ‚Üí For whom ‚Üí Why it matters).

## Tech Focus Areas

- AI/ML: model integration, pipelines, lightweight evaluation loops
- Web: API design, service architecture, pragmatic frontend integration
- Cloud: deployability, modular infrastructure, scalability foundations

---

## Core Skills

- Languages: Python, JavaScript (Node & browser)
- Patterns: modular service layers, clean abstractions, plugin/extensible designs
- Strengths: rapid prototyping ‚Üí hardening, developer experience, automation

---

## How I Work

- Ship incremental value; refactor with intent (avoid premature rewrites)
- Favor explicit contracts, clear boundaries, and testable modules
- Instrument + observe early (latency, correctness, usage)
- Build for extension: today‚Äôs tool ‚Üí tomorrow‚Äôs platform

---

## In Progress / Current Focus

- Expanding ZamAI‚Äôs architecture (add specifics: e.g., multi-model routing, evaluation harness, plugin API)
- Evolving ZamAI-Zeerak (add specifics: e.g., observability, metadata enrichment, retrieval intelligence)
- Exploring patterns for reliable AI integration in real products

(Add concrete bullets when ready: e.g., ‚ÄúImplemented X reducing response time by Y%‚Äù)

---

## Looking For

- Collaborators / contributors interested in AI tooling or platform layers
- Feedback on early design decisions in ZamAI & ZamAI-Zeerak
- Potential integrations or usage in real-world apps

---

## Get in Touch

- GitHub: https://github.com/tasal9  
(Add optional: email, site, LinkedIn, Discord, etc.)

---

## TL;DR

I build AI-centric and web/cloud software with a focus on extensibility, clarity, and real-world usefulness‚Äîcurrently channeling that into ZamAI and ZamAI-Zeerak.

### (Optional) Quick Metrics Section (Fill In Later)

- Users / installs / stars: (add when available)
- Performance improvements: (e.g., ‚ÄúReduced inference cost by X%‚Äù)
- Adoption milestones: (e.g., ‚ÄúIntegrated into N internal projects‚Äù)

---

### Next Step

If you give me:
- One‚Äëline value prop for each project (ZamAI, ZamAI-Zeerak)
- Any concrete metrics or outcomes
- Preferred contact channels

‚Ä¶I can produce a fully finalized version without placeholders.

## Solution

Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim source code in order
to achieve the following goals:

- Simplify maintenance to improve the speed that bug fixes and features get
  merged.
- Split the work among multiple developers.
- Enable the implementation of new/modern user interfaces without any
  modifications to the core source.
- Improve the extensibility power with a new plugin architecture based on
  coprocesses. Plugins will be written in any programming language without
  any explicit support from the editor.

By achieving those goals new developers will soon join the community,
consequently improving the editor for all users.

It is important to emphasize that **this is not a project to rewrite Vim from
scratch** or transform it into an IDE (though the new features provided will
enable IDE-like distributions of the editor). The changes implemented here
should have little impact on Vim's editing model or Vimscript in general. Most
Vimscript plugins should continue to work normally.

The following topics contain brief explanations of the major changes (and
motivations) that will be performed in the first iteration.

### Migrate to a CMake-based build

The source tree has dozens (if not hundreds) of files dedicated to building Vim on various platforms with different configurations, and many of these files
look abandoned or outdated. Most users don't care about selecting individual
features and just compile using `--with-features=huge`, which still generates an
executable that is small enough even for lightweight systems by today's
standards.

All those files will be removed and Vim will be built using [CMake][], a modern
build system that generates build scripts for the most relevant platforms.

[CMake]: http://cmake.org/

### Legacy support and compile-time features

Vim has a significant amount of code dedicated to supporting legacy systems and
compilers. All that code increases the maintenance burden and will be removed.

Most optional features will no longer be optional (see above), with the
exception of some broken and useless features (e.g. NetBeans and Sun WorkShop
integration) which will be removed permanently. Vi emulation will also be
removed (setting `nocompatible` will be a no-op).

### Platform-specific code

Most of the platform-specific code will be removed and [libuv][] will be used to
handle system differences.

libuv is a modern multi-platform library with functions to perform common system
tasks, and supports most unixes and Windows, so the vast majority of Vim's
community will be covered.

### New plugin architecture

All code supporting embedded scripting language interpreters will be replaced by
a new plugin system that supports extensions written in any programming
language. Compatibility layers will be provided for legacy Vim plugins written in some of the
currently supported scripting languages such as Python or Ruby. Most plugins
should work on Neovim with little modification, if any. 

Moreover, GUIs are implemented as plugins, decoupled from the Neovim core.
