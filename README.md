# Hi, I'm Yaqoob Tasal (tasal9) 👋

**Software Engineer | AI & ML Practitioner | Full‑Stack (Python / JavaScript) | Cloud Enthusiast**

I build practical AI systems and developer tooling — with a focus on clean architecture, experiment velocity, and production robustness.

## 🚀 Featured Projects
| Project | What It Is | Highlights |
|---------|------------|------------|
| **ZamAI** | Modular AI platform / toolkit | Pluggable pipelines, model experimentation, config-driven workflows |
| **ZamAI-Zeerak** | Extension / companion to ZamAI | Advanced inference utilities, observability hooks, evaluation harness |

> Ask me about designing maintainable ML experimentation layers or bridging research-to-production.

## 🧠 Core Skill Areas
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (TypeScript-ready)
- **AI / ML:** Modeling workflows, evaluation pipelines, prompt/tool orchestration
- **Web Dev:** API design (FastAPI/Express), modular frontends, integration patterns
- **Cloud & Ops:** Containerization, reproducible environments, deployment hygiene
- **Architecture Focus:** Separation of concerns, configuration ergonomics, testability

## 🧩 Engineering Principles I Value
- Data & model version traceability
- Explicit contracts over "magic"
- Small, composable abstractions
- Metrics + observability first
- Automation over repetition

## 🔭 Current Focus
- Enhancing ZamAI’s extensibility surface
- Improving evaluation + feedback loops in AI-assisted apps
- Exploring lightweight agentic patterns without over-engineering

## 📈 Potential Collaboration Ideas
| Area | Example |
|------|---------|
| ML Platform | Unified config & experiment DSL |
| Evaluation | Automated regression scoring for model updates |
| Tooling | Dev-friendly SDKs for AI features |
| Observability | Latency / quality dashboards for inferencing |

If you’d like:
1. I can add shields, workflow badges, or a dynamic “recent activity” section.
2. Provide a CONTRIBUTING.md template for external collaborators on ZamAI.
3. Generate architecture diagrams (Mermaid) for ZamAI once you share structure.

Let me know and I’ll iterate.
